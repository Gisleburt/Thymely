Thymely
=======

I wanted a simple app to keep track of what I was doing at work making it easier to provide accounts accurate for our clients. I also wanted to make something to show off my [LazyData][] ORM. As part of this development I also started making my own basic framework, simply called [Gisleburt][], with an emphasis on flexability.

Some might question the choice of making my own tools over professionally made and well supported alternatives like [Zend][] and [Doctrine][]. I actually really like these, but I also really enjoy making my own stuff too. This isn't really about making the perfect app. Its about making something fun and (I'll admit) showing off a bit.

The name 'Thymely' has been shamelessly stolen from a hack day project I worked on with [Nathan Kunicki][] and Rob Law. That version was intended as a simple task management mobile app.
